We live in times of change. AI is still flourishing, and although it often falls short at the moment, there is no doubt that this technology will continue to develop and improve. What is certain is that AI is increasingly changing our reality - including having a growing impact on the daily lives of many employees, including programmers.

AI is becoming a part of software development, making life easier for programmers in various ways by taking over tedious tasks and streamlining work. As a result, products are being created faster.

It has also been used for years in the form of Machine Learning - and in this area, it has already helped create new job positions.

What lies ahead? For now, it looks like programmers will still be needed, but the nature of their work, the required skills, and the areas they focus on will change somewhat.

Let's analyze this topic and check what the experts are saying.

According to a team of researchers at the US Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, there’s a high chance that AI will replace software developers as early as 2040.

Software developers are understandably worried. In fact, nearly 30 percent of the 550 software developers surveyed by Evans Data Corporation, a California-based market research firm that specializes in software development, believe that their development efforts will be replaced by artificial intelligence in the foreseeable future.

AI has significantly impacted the software development landscape in recent years, bringing about several notable changes and advancements. Programmers are using AI to generate code, automate repetitive and boring tasks, detect bugs easier, and make the DevOps process more efficient.

With the help of AI, developers can automate some types of software development tasks, which boosts their productivity and efficiency. For example, AI-powered tools can automatically generate code snippets, perform code refactoring, and assist in bug detection and fixing. That helps to save time and focus on more complex and critical aspects of software development.

AI tools can generate code based on existing patterns and examples. This includes auto-complete suggestions in integrated development environments (IDEs) and AI-generated code snippets for specific tasks. AI can also optimize code by identifying redundant or inefficient parts and suggesting improvements.

Even if you're tempted, we don't recommend relying solely on AI tools in terms of code generation. Created code should be checked by a programmer. AI can still write it a bit sloppy; the code will need some improvements and cleaning. However, it will still boost effectiveness and, most likely, decrease boredom.

AI also influenced the testing and quality assurance processes. AI-based testing tools can analyze code, identify potential vulnerabilities, and automatically generate test cases. Machine learning techniques are employed to learn from past test results and predict areas of code that are more likely to contain bugs. This helps developers identify and fix issues early in the development cycle, leading to higher-quality software.

AI has contributed to the evolution of DevOps practices and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. AI techniques can analyze code changes, test results, and production metrics to provide insights on performance, quality, and potential issues. This helps streamline the software development lifecycle, improve deployment processes, and enhance overall software quality.

NLP, a subfield of AI, has made significant strides in understanding and processing human language. NLP technologies have influenced software development through the development of chatbots, virtual assistants, and voice-activated interfaces. These applications allow users to interact with software systems using natural language, enhancing user experiences and opening up new avenues for software development.

AI algorithms analyze vast amounts of data to make intelligent recommendations and personalize software experiences. For example, AI-powered recommendation systems are used in e-commerce applications to suggest products based on user preferences and browsing history. Similarly, AI can personalize user interfaces, content, and features based on individual user behavior and patterns.

There are several AI tools and frameworks that are commonly used in software development to facilitate work and enable the development of AI-driven applications. Here are some of the most popular ones:

AI is applied in various domains, such as healthcare, finance, robotics, and autonomous systems. Developers should acquire domain-specific knowledge to understand the challenges, requirements, and constraints of specific industries.

The field of AI is evolving rapidly, so developers must embrace lifelong learning. They should stay updated with the latest research, techniques, and advancements in AI. Keeping up with online courses, attending conferences, participating in AI communities, and exploring open-source projects can help developers stay ahead in this dynamic field.

Strong problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and the ability to break down complex problems into manageable components are crucial in designing effective AI solutions.

Working with data scientists, domain experts, and other stakeholders to develop AI solutions that meet diverse needs. Effective collaboration requires good communication and teamwork skills.

When software engineers are able to understand the business side of a project, they can make better decisions and precise prioritization.

Clearly, it would be virtually impossible for most software developers to master each and every AI-related skill, especially considering the breakneck speed at which the field of AI is moving forward. That’s why software developers who want to stay relevant in the age of AI should see themselves as expert-generalists and treat learning new skills as an ongoing process.

Having a breadth of knowledge makes it far easier to acquire deep expertise in one particular area based on the current market demand. “[Those who will be successful will be the developers that have the best understanding [of] the essential complexity of their domains: which data are important [and] the impact of uncertainty on decision making, etc.,” says Todd Schiller, head of engineering at MOKA, a disruptive technologies advisory firm.

Software developers won’t have to know the intricate details of the latest machine learning algorithms or possess excellent command of the trendiest programming language to work on AI projects, but not being able to navigate the AI landscape and learn new skills at the speed of business won’t be equally optional.

After analyzing all these opinions and data, the answer seems to be "yes", don't you think?

Software engineering involves solving complex problems, designing algorithms, and developing intricate software systems. While AI can assist in automating certain repetitive tasks and optimizing processes, it still requires human expertise to conceptualize, architect, and design complex software solutions that meet specific requirements.

Creativity and innovation are also indispensable. These qualities are needed while designing user interfaces, creating unique user experiences, and developing novel algorithms. AI can generate solutions based on existing patterns and data, but it currently lacks the ability to match human creativity and intuition.

Software engineers also possess contextual understanding and the ability to adapt to changing requirements. They work closely with stakeholders to gather requirements, understand business needs, and create software solutions that align with specific contexts. While AI can help them with data analysis and pattern recognition, but human software engineers are better equipped to understand complex contexts, make informed decisions, and adapt software systems accordingly.

"A large portion of programmers of tomorrow do not maintain complex software repositories, write intricate programs, or analyze their running times,” believes Andrej Karpathy, a former research scientist at OpenAI who now serves as Director of AI at Tesla. “They collect, clean, manipulate, label, analyze and visualize data that feeds neural networks."

Karpathy has proposed a new software development process for the age of AI, called Software 2.0, and its key components include problem and goal definition, data collection, data preparation, model learning, model deployment and integration, and model management. Software developers of the future will source and compose large data sets to train applications to be smart, instead of hard-coding the desired capabilities.

Artificial intelligence will radically reshape software development and force software developers to acquire new skills in order to stay relevant. Those who will adapt most successfully to the coming era will get to enjoy an abundance of work opportunities, but the process will require a different mindset than many software developers have today.
