GEMINI SUMMARY:
----------------------------------------
Here's a comprehensive summary analyzing the automation risk for Mechanical Engineers in the next 5 years, specifically tailored for loan risk assessment:

**1. Comprehensive Summary (300-500 words)**

The provided web content assesses the potential for automation replacing Mechanical Engineers. The overall conclusion, supported by a calculated automation risk and user sentiment, is that the risk is relatively **low** (21-40%). This suggests that Mechanical Engineers are not likely to be fully replaced by AI and robots within the next 5 years or even the next two decades. The calculated automation risk is estimated at 30%.

Several factors contribute to this low-risk assessment. Firstly, the job requires a combination of technical expertise and human-centric skills. Many aspects of a Mechanical Engineer's work, such as real-world decision-making, value judgments, prioritizing, physical interaction with machines, problem-solving in unpredictable environments (e.g., rust in cars), and ethical considerations, are difficult to automate effectively with current and near-future AI technology. User comments highlight the importance of creativity, innovation, and the ability to handle novel challenges, all areas where AI currently struggles.

The content emphasizes that AI may augment certain tasks performed by Mechanical Engineers, such as stress analysis and defect detection, potentially increasing efficiency, but is unlikely to replace the entire role. Some users envision AI-aided machines requiring Mechanical Engineers for oversight and maintenance. However, one dissenting opinion highlights concerns about the devaluation of engineering degrees, cost-cutting pressures, and the potential for companies to train AI models on specific products and goals, potentially impacting entry-level positions.

Looking at the labor market, the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects an 11% growth in Mechanical Engineer job openings by 2033. As of 2023, there were 281,290 Mechanical Engineers employed in the U.S., representing a small percentage of the overall workforce. The profession is also relatively highly paid, with a median annual wage of $99,510 in 2023, significantly higher than the national median wage. Updated projections are due in September 2025, which will give more insight into the job market in the near future.

For loan risk assessment, this translates to a relatively stable and well-compensated profession with decent projected growth. While automation might alter some aspects of the job, it's unlikely to lead to widespread job displacement in the short to medium term.
The sentiment over time graph, although not accessible via the text itself, is mentioned as a significant indicator of sentiment trends.

**5. Financial Data or Forecasts if Available**

*   **Median Annual Wage (2023):** $99,510. The data suggests the profession is financially stable and well-compensated.
*   **National Median Wage (2023):** $48,060. Demonstrating Mechanical Engineers earn significantly more.
*   The 11% job growth projection suggests a stable and growing demand for Mechanical Engineers, potentially leading to continued strong earning potential.

**Implications for Loan Risk Assessment:**

Based on this information, Mechanical Engineers present a **low to moderate risk** profile for loan applicants. The job security, high earning potential, and projected growth suggest a strong ability to repay loans. However, lenders should be aware of:

*   **Potential for AI to affect specific tasks:** While full replacement is unlikely, changes in job duties and the need for continuous learning to adapt to new technologies might be necessary.
*   **Industry-specific risks:** Monitor industries where mechanical engineers are employed, as some sectors might experience higher automation rates than others.
*   **Entry-level positions:** Be mindful of the comments saying junior-level positions may be impacted by widespread adoption of AI tools.
*   **Monitor BLS updates:** The updated projections due in September 2025 could provide further insights into the long-term employment outlook.

depends a lot on real world decision making, value judgements/deciding what you believe is important to prioritise and management
Matthew L (Low) 28 days ago
As AI-aided machines replace human workers (e.g. Spot), they will need mechanical engineers to oversee them.
I'm a mech eng, and IAs can't actually do a lot of stuff we do.
nick g (Highly likely) 3 months ago
the protein mapping breakthrough demonstated complex pattern intuition and accuracy. to cut costs due to drop in B.S. degrees devaluating and increased liabilities, companies will listen to Consultants advocating training models on their products and goals, this will wipe out any entery level position. the semiconductor industry is rapidly cutting engineering jobs, anyone who says otherwise is blissfully ignorant...

You need someone to make robots for robots to replace them.
Valentina C (Low) 4 months ago
They prob wont take the job cs you need to see the machines, scan them to find the mistakes, and be reallly specialized on that area to find them, but its still very possible to do it. Im scared.
John (In college and worked in some factorys) (Low) 8 months ago
I think some mechanical engineers will get replaced by the gain in efficiency that other engineers get form AI, a total AI/Robot taking of the job is not in the foreseeable future.
Arthur Schroeder (No chance) 10 months ago
It’s a very hard job and very complicated and I don’t think robots are automating that any time soon…
Gavin (No chance) 1 year ago
Artificial intelligence does not have the creativity needed or the ability to fully understand some of the problems people go through throughout the world.
Raúl (No chance) 1 year ago
I think it has no chance because cars can have rust or other problems a robot can't understand and deal whit them.
Congo (No chance) 1 year ago
Simply in this area of engineering there is no chance of robot or AI taking it. Maybe in the long run yes, but there is still a pretty long way of developing AI to substitute a mechanical engineer, for now and 1 or 2 decades is impossible. Maybe in the third decade or fourth but with a lot of funding and a lot of training. Because you need to think that to be able to make an AI/robot that can surpass or substitute a human it will need to be only focused on this area, not pretty cost-effective, for the AI industries.
Cooper Johnston (No chance) 1 year ago
there is no robot that can replicate the human thought process and thinking
Burke (No chance) 1 year ago
Mechanical Engineering, like all disciplines of engineering, requires the ability to make difficult ethical decisions regarding systems that affect all of society. This is something that not even the most advanced generalized AI of the future is capable of doing.

Engineering is also a profession, which means that its members set the standards for who can be called an engineer and take responsibility for their decisions. AI cannot make decisions in light of the weight of their actions. It is a tool, not a person, which ultimately undermines any semblance of accountability that is necessary for engineering to be a respectable and societally beneficial profession.

I believe mechanical engineering to be far too interdisciplinary (design, manufacturing, economics) to be fully automated a whole. I see AI taking over or speeding up certain specific tasks that mechanical engineers are burdened with, never their entire role.
Ninjamokama_3 (Low) 1 year ago
There are way too many human aspects about engineering. It's next to impossible for AI to automate, let alone replace, every aspect of an engineer's job
John F. Sutton (Low) 1 year ago
This is a sometimes tough job and would be hard to automate for good reason such as:

1. Fixing stuff, this is complicated as it could literally be anything that could be broken about something.
2. Complexity, the more complex a job is, the more unlikely this job will be taken, this job is hard and absurdly complex sometimes.
3. Problems, this job can cause lots of issues with AI and it is the communication and bugs/viruses that could occur, the cost of these robots would be nuts and it would be hard to afford these machines.
4. Design, AI is a complex work of coding, there is one problem, how would they make the design of there robots that won't screw up how they work, they have to be just right to mimic a person and that would be hard to do.
Since Mechanical Engineering has to deal with problems beyond reasonable thinking and has to create something entirely new and possibly unrelated to any previous topic, AI could help but never replace a mechanical engineer
dhaarini (Uncertain) 1 year ago
no trained machine has ever come too close to designing any whole equipment. but certainly, I feel there are specific jobs that could be automated like pressure, stress, strain detection and analysis
d (No chance) 1 year ago
The prompt is "next 20 years". No chance. There are so many industrial and mechanical problems that have yet to be solved, and AI right now simply trains on what's already been done and can then piece it together using predictions. Decent for language, OK but not great for art, horrible for design if you are actually trying to tackle a novel challenge. And if it's not novel... then what's the point? Just google it.
