GEMINI SUMMARY:
----------------------------------------
Here's a detailed summary of the provided web content, focusing on the "pollution projection for Automotive region in 5 years" query and relevant information for loan risk assessment:

**1. Comprehensive Summary:**

The U.S. EPA article on "Carbon Pollution from Transportation" highlights the significant contribution of the transportation sector to overall U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Accounting for approximately 28% of total U.S. GHG emissions, the sector's emissions increased more than any other sector between 1990 and 2022. The EPA is actively working to reduce these emissions through various programs and regulations.

A key focus is on setting GHG emissions standards for cars, trucks, and aircraft.  The joint EPA and DOT rule-making sets standards for cars, light trucks, and heavy-duty trucks. Light-duty regulations are projected to significantly cut GHG emissions (7 billion metric tons over the lifetime of vehicles sold in model years 2027-2032) while also nearly doubling fuel efficiency and reducing dependence on oil.  Heavy-duty regulations are projected to reduce GHG emissions by about 1 billion metric tons over the life of the vehicles built under the program.

The EPA also promotes the use of renewable fuels through the Renewable Fuel Standard program. This program aims to reduce GHG emissions by replacing fossil fuels with fuels derived from plants and biomass. Standards are also being set internationally for aircraft emissions, aligning with ICAO standards.

Furthermore, the federal government is mandated to purchase low-GHG emitting vehicles, contributing to a "greener" federal fleet. The SmartWay program aims to improve supply chain efficiency in the freight transportation sector, leading to reduced GHG emissions and fuel costs. The EPA also provides information to consumers through fuel economy labels and online resources to help them make informed choices about fuel-efficient and lower-emission vehicles.  State and local resources are also available to assist in achieving air quality and transportation objectives.

The article emphasizes that reducing GHG emissions from transportation requires a multi-pronged approach, including the adoption of low-carbon fuels, the development and deployment of new vehicle technologies, strategies to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and more efficient vehicle operation.

Transportation and Climate Change

Burning fossil fuels like gasoline and diesel releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. The buildup of carbon dioxide (CO) and other greenhouse gases like methane (CH), nitrous oxide (NO), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) is causing the Earth’s atmosphere to warm, resulting in changes to the climate we are already starting to see today.

​Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation account for about 28 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making it the largest contributor of U.S. GHG emissions. Between 1990 and 2022, GHG emissions in the transportation sector increased more in absolute terms than any other sector.
